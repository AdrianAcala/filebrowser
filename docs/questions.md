# Q&A topics

## When will there be a stable release?

Please see [roadmap](roadmap.md) for future plans -- yes a stable release will eventually come.

## Can you add FileBrowser Quantum features to the original file browser?

This "Quantum" version fork was created because I wanted certain features that are a dramatic and opinionated departure from the OG filebrowser. If you look at the original filebrowser repo pull requests, you will find there are many basic features that remain open for many months or years with very little attention.

If the original filebrowser maintainers were more active and if I didn't have to worry about spending months or years playing politics about the concequences of these drastic changes, I would contribute to the original repository.

However, **I will not make an modifications to the original filebrowser**, for these reasons:

1. My changes are opinionated and I want full control over the experience (and consequences) of the changes. For example I removed the terminal, runners, command line flags, and more. These are changes that would probably be highly contested. I think the experience is better without them, or with the changes -- and I hope you agree.
2. Contributing to that open source project takes a long time, I may never see my changes actually make it in and don't want to waste my time trying for years, I only have so much time.
3. This project was originally a fork, but that quickly changed. There are hundereds of thousands of changes and complete departures from the original codebase. I can't simply "port" the features I write on this repo over to the OG file browser.

Both of these repos being open source means YOU can migrate these features if you want! Feel free to spend the effort and do so for the community. I am not the only one capable of doing it and I encourage this if you have the time, energy, and knowhow to do it.

## I notice a lot of things that don't work like the original file browser repo, how can I get this fixed?

Please open issues and/or pull requests from a forked repo if you notice issues that should be fixed. Some changes are intentional and I may have left things broken. For example, I am not fully confident user rules work in 100% of places. When you notice things, please let me know and I will check if its an intentional change or a bug. 

## Is there a way to donate or support this project?

Nope... not yet! It's still "unfinished" in my opinion, so I don't want to ask for any money from it. But if you have a strong desire to donate, email info@quantumx-apps.com to get in touch.

## Is there an email or phone I can contact?

Yes - Please contact info@quantumx-apps.com for any off-github topics. If its related to a specific application or repo such as this filebrowser, please open an issue or pull request instead. Email is only for corrospondance unrelated to technical changes or issues.

## Can I fork this repo and use it?

This repo has the same license as the original filebrowser, apache-2.0. Feel free to use in any way that follows the license. I have no issues with anything personally -- its open source please do as you like. However, since this is a fork of the OG repo, I am not sure what the consequences are for a fork of this repo.

## Who are the maintainers for FileBrowser Quantum?

Right now, just me as a personal hobby and some small contributions from the community. Once I can release a confident stable version, I plan to publicize this application more on social media. Hopefully, in the future I could pick up some extra contributors.

I'm not looking for contributors at the moment, but if you want to me a contributor feel free to email me at info@quantumx-apps.com to see about getting contributor access.

## Are there plans to charge for this product?

No, this repo and project will always be free to use.

## Is there a discord for this fork?

Not yet, generally most interactions should happen on github for now.
